# Tenant Integration Notes

This directory structure is prepared for integration with Sam's tenant dashboard implementation.

## Current Status
- Directory structure exists to match Sam's branch
- Tenant routes are temporarily commented out in `/src/routes/index.tsx`
- Ready for smooth integration without conflicts

## Integration Steps (when ready)
1. Copy Sam's Dashboard components
2. Copy Sam's other tenant page components (Users, Branches, etc.)
3. Uncomment and update routes in `/src/routes/index.tsx`
4. Add proper component imports

## Files to preserve from Sam's branch:
- All Dashboard components with their clean, fresh design
- User management components
- Branch management components
- Reports and other tenant-specific features
